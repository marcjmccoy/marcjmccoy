Highlights:
- I’m interested in the applications of data science and machine learning in medicine, data science, and commerce.
- I’m currently focused on learning advanced python, OOP, and intermediate C++!
- I have experience on both server-side and client-side, however most of my experience to this point has been on the server-side.
- I’m looking to collaborate on medical research projects related to genetics and head and neck oncology.
- Reach me on github or linkedin.

More Detail:
- I am an experienced data scientist and former investment banking analyst with strong fundamental front end and back end programming skills. My true passion lies in life science innovation and applying novel methods to both clinical and business problems. I believe technology has the capacity to diversify the Canadian economy and improve healthcare in a meaningful way for all. I have a breadth of experience working in capital markets and have been consistently relied upon to complete highly technical valuation tasks. I am currently a Medical (MD) Student at the University of Calgary in the Leaders in Medicine (LIM) program. In my spare time I am completing Level II of the CFA program as well as the FM exam as part of the Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA) program. I recently developed and patented a novel financial technology platform which subsequently gained traction with two regional Western Canadian Chartered Financial Institutions. Please send me a PM if you would like to connect.

-- Please note most of my daily coding work is propriety because of my current employment contract. I look forward to spending more time on open source tools upon completion of my summer internship. I intend on releasing an open source .rmd statistical analysis template file for Head and Neck Oncology in the coming months. If you have any sources on how to write sharp OOP please send me a PM.
