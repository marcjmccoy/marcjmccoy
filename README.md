- Hi, I’m @marcjmccoy
- I’m interested in the applications of data science and machine learning in medicine, data science, and commerce.
- I’m currently focused on learning advanced python, OOP, and intermediate C++!
- I have experience on both server-side and client-side, but most of my experience to this point has been on the server-side.
- I’m looking to collaborate on medical research projects related to genetics and head and neck oncology.
- Reach me on github, linkedin, or via email.

-- Please note most of my daily coding work is propriety because of my current employment contract. I look forward to spending more time on open source tools upon completion of my summer internship. I intend on releasing an open source .rmd statistical analysis template file for Head and Neck Oncology in the coming months. If you have any sources on how to write sharp OOP please send me a PM.
