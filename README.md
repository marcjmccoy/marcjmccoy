Highlights:
- I am a medical doctor, experienced data scientist, and former investment banking analyst. My true passion lies in life science innovation and applying novel methods to both clinical and business problems. I believe technology has the capacity to diversify the Canadian economy and improve healthcare in a meaningful way for all. I have a breadth of experience working in capital markets and have been consistently relied upon to complete highly technical valuation tasks. I am currently a Medical (MD) Student at the University of Calgary in the Leaders in Medicine (LIM) program. In my spare time I am completing the CFA program as well as the IFM exam as part of the Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA) program. I recently developed and patented a novel financial technology platform which subsequently gained traction with two regional Western Canadian Chartered Financial Institutions. Please send me a PM if you would like to connect.
