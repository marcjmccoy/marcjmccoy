- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcjmccoy
- 👀 I’m interested in the applications of data science and machine learning in medicine, data science, and commerce.
- 🌱 I’m currently focused on learning advanced python, OOP, and intermediate C++!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical research projects related to genetics and head and neck oncology.
- 📫 Reach me on github, linkedin, or via email.

-- Please note most of my daily coding work is propriety because of my current employement contract. I look forward to spending more time on open source tools upon completion of my summer internship.
