Highlights:
- I am a medical doctor, experienced data scientist, and former investment banking analyst. My true passion lies in life science innovation and applying novel methods to both clinical and business problems. I believe technology has the capacity to diversify the Canadian economy and improve healthcare in a meaningful way for all. I have a breadth of experience working in capital markets and have been consistently relied upon to complete highly technical valuation tasks. I graduated from the University of Calgary's Leaders in Medicine (LIM) program. During medical school I completed my MSc in Data Science. In my spare time I am completing the CFA program as well as the Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA) program.

-- Please note most of my daily coding work is proprietary because of my current employment contract. I look forward to spending more time on open source tools in the future.
